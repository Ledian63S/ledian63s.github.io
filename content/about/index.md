Hello, my name is Ledian Leka,

I consider myself a creative, correct, scattered and restless person.

At the end of 2020, due to things in life, I got to know the immense world of ERP, until then I had not heard anything about Navinson/Business Central or its history. 

Although I had programmed for 2 years and a half in another technology everything was new to me. I found myself with a huge wall, so many concepts, so much theory and so much world to discover.
Thus began my career as a "Business Central programmer"

<!-- Hello! Interestingly, I got introduced to programming in my freshman year at [Birla Institute Of Technology,  Mesra](https://www.bitmesra.ac.in/) where I completed my Bachelors in Computer Science and Engineering (2016-2020) with [86.3% aggregate](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1G4UBPBP0mvWZLRdkF_EcpmKKGp7_OA8U/view?usp=sharing).

I'm currently working as a developer for **Bell Canada** in the Amdocs Digital Delivery unit. My responsibilty includes Java/Spring based microservices development & testing. 

I'm also an [Innovation Agent](https://drive.google.com/file/d/117KS9QnDrcg7dllcAzGz_b7qQPgR3pGs/view?usp=sharing) fostering the culture of creativity and innovation at Amdocs, India.

I have been awarded as Winner in [Innovation Nugget](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1PzTZkXlQV9ldZxqmBbbO94uIqrhSwvcq/view?usp=sharing), Creativity Jam, [Design Thinking Hackathon](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1hXCATvKwzHCvctHtElsqFg5YIqabz22O/view?usp=sharing) and Runners-Up in [Project ICE Fair](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1exB19OoQ5dzU2mg4qbdkNutA25TGBWV3/view?usp=sharing) by Amdocs. -->

Here are a few technologies Iâ€™ve been working with recently:
