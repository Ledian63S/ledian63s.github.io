Hello, my name is Ledian Leka,

I consider myself a creative, correct, scattered and restless person.

At the end of 2020, due to things in life, I got to know the immense world of ERP — until then I had not heard anything about Navision/Business Central or its history. Although I had been programming for two and a half years in another technology, everything was new to me. I found myself facing a huge wall of concepts, theory and a world to discover. Thus began my career as a Business Central developer.

Each step has pushed me to grow both technically and professionally.
